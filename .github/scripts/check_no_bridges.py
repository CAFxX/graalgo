No-bridges check (2026-10-15, his direct order).

Fails if the diff introduces new bridges:
- New synth_*.go files
- New package-name conditionals in frontend/backend
- New panic stubs
- New wire node kinds for stdlib functions
- New synthetic function registrations

Existing bridges are grandfathered (they're in the removal queue — see
docs/arch/bridge-inventory.md). This check only looks at ADDED lines in the diff.

Diff sources, in order:
  1. origin/master...HEAD  (PR / feature branch)
  2. <before>...HEAD       (direct master push: --before/NO_BRIDGES_BEFORE
                           carries the pre-push head — CI passes
                           github.event.before. wt.py integrate
                           fast-forward-merges multi-commit lane branches,
                           so HEAD~1 alone would inspect only the tip commit;
                           the push's FULL range must be diffed)
  3. git diff HEAD         (uncommitted working-tree changes)
  4. git diff --cached     (staged changes)
  5. HEAD~1...HEAD         (fallback when no pre-push head is known; covers
                           only the tip commit)

The check NEVER passes vacuously: if no diff can be determined (e.g. a
shallow checkout with no history, or an unresolvable --before SHA), it fails
loudly instead of skipping.
CI must check out full history (fetch-depth: 0) for the pre-push range to
resolve.

"""
No-bridges check (2026-10-15, his direct order).

Fails if the diff introduces new bridges:
- New synth_*.go files
- New package-name conditionals in frontend/backend
- New panic stubs
- New wire node kinds for stdlib functions
- New synthetic function registrations

Existing bridges are grandfathered (they're in the removal queue — see
docs/arch/bridge-inventory.md). This check only looks at ADDED lines in the diff.

Diff sources, in order:
  1. origin/master...HEAD  (PR / feature branch)
  2. git diff HEAD         (uncommitted working-tree changes)
  3. git diff --cached     (staged changes)
  4. HEAD~1...HEAD         (direct master push: wt.py integrate + push, no PR —
                           checkout lands exactly on origin/master, so 1-3 are
                           all empty; inspect what the push itself introduced)

The check NEVER passes vacuously: if no diff can be determined (e.g. a
shallow checkout with no history), it fails loudly instead of skipping.
CI must check out full history (fetch-depth: 0) for source 4 to resolve.

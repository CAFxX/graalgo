/**
 * {@code sync.Pool} (graalgo): per-thread private + shared pools, cross-
 * thread stealing, a global spillover, and a weakly-held victim
 * generation.
 *
 * <p>gc mapping (see {@code sync/pool.go} in go1.27.1):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Each JVM thread is a "P": the per-P {@code poolLocal} becomes a
 *       {@link ThreadLocal} {@code Local} with a 1-item {@code private}
 *       slot and a bounded {@code shared} queue. The fast paths
 *       ({@link #put} filling private/shared, {@link #get} draining them)
 *       are lock-free — each {@code Local} is thread-confined on its
 *       fast path, exactly like gc's per-P pools under {@code pin()}.</li>
 *   <li>Cross-thread sharing (gc's {@code getSlow} stealing from other
 *       Ps' shared queues via the {@code allPools} registry) scans the
 *       registered {@code Local}s' shared queues under the pool lock,
 *       then their {@code private} slots. The shared queues are
 *       {@link ConcurrentLinkedDeque}s and the private slot an
 *       {@link java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference}, so an owner
 *       racing a thief is safe. Stealing {@code private} is a deliberate
 *       JVM adaptation (see the field doc): gc's {@code getSlow} skips it
 *       because Ps are immortal; our threads are not. Locals of dead
 *       threads stay registered — their items remain stealable. The
 *       registry is bounded in practice by the scheduler's carrier pool
 *       plus the threads that touch the pool.</li>
 *   <li>Victim cache + GC interaction: gc rotates primary→victim at each
 *       GC stop-the-world ({@code poolCleanup}); there is no STW hook on
 *       the JVM, so the victim holds {@link WeakReference}s. The JVM GC
 *       reclaims them under memory pressure — the documented "any item
 *       stored in the Pool may be removed automatically at any time"
 *       behavior, genuinely GC-driven. Overflow from a full thread-local
 *       shared queue spills to the global queue; overflow from a full
 *       global queue spills into the victim — memory stays bounded.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Go semantics preserved:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code Put(nil)} is a no-op (gc parity).</li>
 *   <li>{@code Get} returns an arbitrary previously-Put item, including
 *       items Put by other threads; a nil return with {@code New} set
 *       means the caller invokes {@code New} (done by the syncop node,
 *       outside any lock — gc likewise calls {@code New} without the
 *       pool lock).</li>
 *   <li>The {@code New} field ({@code func() any}) is a volatile slot;
 *       gc forbids changing it concurrently with {@code Get}, publication
 *       is still safe.</li>
 *   <li>A Pool value copied after first use shares the pools (the Go value
 *       IS this object — ADR-0002 D1); gc's noCopy is vet-level only.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>No scheduler interaction: pool operations never block.
